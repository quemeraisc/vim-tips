### `<C-x>` followed by `<C-f>` for filename completion

###  Omni completion :
`<C-x>` followed by `<C-o>` opens the list of possible completion.
That list can be navigated through with `<C-n>` and `<C-p>` 

### Spell checking, by default in 'en'
`set spell` switches on the spell checking, misspelt words are highlighted
`z=` provides a list of possible correct spelling, just type the number of the wanted word in the list.
